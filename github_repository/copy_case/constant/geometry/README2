original_blade.stl is the unrotated blade stl file

Allrun will rotate it twice.
The first will rotate about the x axis to the given pitch angle, and this will be named blade_pitch
The second will rotate blade_pitch to the given cone angle (about the y axis) and this will be called blade.stl

Openfoam will use the geometry named 'blade.stl'
